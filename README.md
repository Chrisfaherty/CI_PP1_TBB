### Features Left to Implement
    * A feature that I would like to implement in the future is to check out on the sight when you sign up for a subscription,

* The three webpages were tested to be responsive as a desktop, tablet and mobile screensize,
* All images and text was reviewed and confirmed to be readable,
* The Form works as it requires the user to input a name, email & select a package before it can be submitted.

### Bugs
**Solved Bugs**
* When working with the footer on the home pace in mobile the fotter would move up behind the contacts and location section.
    * This was resolved by fixing the footers position to the bottom of the page and giving it a transparent background so that it could stay at the bottom of the screen and move with the page.
